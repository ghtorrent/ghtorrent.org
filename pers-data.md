## Accessing personal data

As of Mar 2016, the GHTorrent project does not offer personal data
(namely, emails and real names) for download. For research purposes,
you can request access to a file containing a mapping between
logins and personal data.

To access the file containing personal data, you will need to [edit this page](https://github.com/ghtorrent/ghtorrent.org/blob/master/pers-data.md) to include the following details.
When your pull request has been accepted, we will mail you the link
to the data.
