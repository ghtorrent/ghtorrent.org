title: Guidelines for Contacting GitHub Users

Contacting GitHub users is sometimes necessary for research projects, but certain people regard this as spam and do not appreciate it. Even people who would ordinarily be willing to help in surveys can end up becoming hostile to requests due to the frequency with which they receive them. Due to the number of researchers who study the free software community, we have to be mindful of how many emails we are sending. Here are some tips to avoid annoying people:

- Do not contact users who have signed up for the [do-not-survey-list](https://github.com/slang800/do-not-survey-list). These users have explicitly stated that they don't want to be involved in surveys.
- Try to limit your data collection to a sample of users. While it may be tempting to contact all 12 million developers, it is also likely to leave a bad impression of researchers in general, and can make future studies difficult.
- Don't contact people repeatedly if they fail to reply to your first email. If they weren't interested the first time, follow-ups are much more likely to bother them.
- Don't contact people who have chosen to hide their email address from their profile page. People frequently assume that hiding their email from their profile will prevent them from being contacted. Sometimes, they don't even realize that every commit they make is signed with their email, so we shouldn't assume that users are consenting to being contacted, without checking the display settings on their profile.
- Be especially careful when contacting highly-active developers. Not only to these people receive a massive amount of regular email from their participation in the free software community, but they are the sent a higher-than-average number of requests for surveys too.
